Air Traffic Analysis Project 
============================
University of Colorado and Northrop Grumman

Justin Olson, Michael Muehlbradt, Kristen Hanslik, Mitch Zinser, and Matt Oakley

Air Traffic Analysis is a full stack application, capable of ingesting and storing flight data, processing data and training neural networks, calculating efficient flight routes, displaying historic and calculated flights paths accurately on a map, and allowing interactive user input for requesting more flight paths. This project is extensible, documented, and open-source. Potential applications of this product include: research tool for displaying flight paths, analysis of current and potential flight path heuristics, or database integrated machine learning framework.
